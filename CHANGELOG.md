# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Until `1.0.0`, minor versions may contain breaking changes; they will always be
called out under **Changed** with a migration note.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Repository scaffold: hygiene files, contribution and security policy, issue and
  pull-request templates, Dependabot configuration, and the documentation skeleton.
- `PROBE-FINDINGS.md`, recording behaviour confirmed against a live SAS Viya 4
  deployment — the evidence base the implementation plan rests on.
- ADR-0000 recording the repository licence decision.
- Dual AI pull-request review (Claude and Codex), running on every pull request.
- TypeScript toolchain: extension manifest, strict `tsconfig`, type-aware ESLint,
  Prettier, esbuild bundling, and a single `npm run verify` gate that mirrors CI.
- A minimal extension that activates and contributes **Python on Viya: Show Log**.
- Copyright-header check enforcing the Apache-2.0 §4(b) modification notice on
  files ported from `sassoftware/vscode-sas-extension`.
- ADR-0001 (extension identity and configuration namespace), ADR-0002 (workspace
  trust posture), and ADR-0003 (extension host target).
- `docs/dev/building.md` — prerequisites, the inner loop, and the toolchain
  constraints that fail silently rather than loudly.

### Changed

- **Relicensed from MIT to Apache-2.0** to match the upstream
  `sassoftware/vscode-sas-extension` code this project derives from, and to give
  users an explicit patent grant. See `docs/adr/0000-repository-licence.md`.
